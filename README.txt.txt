Stock prediction using deep neural learning

Predicting stock prices can be difficult since they do not always follow a predictable pattern. Deep neural learning, on the other hand, may be used to find patterns using machine learning. LSTM (long short-term memory) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of memorising information over a long period of time, are one of the most successful strategies for series forecasting. As a result, they are particularly useful for forecasting stock values.

--  Introduction  --

The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model based on recurrent neural networks that can predict the future values of a univariate time series. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture is employed in particular, which has been found to be particularly successful for modelling and forecasting time series. The objective is to train the model using past data and then use it to predict future values of the time series.

TensorFlow deep learning library and Keras high-level interface are used to create the model. NumPy is also used to alter the data and prepare it for usage in the model.

The project is divided into several stages: first, the data is loaded and prepared for use in the model; second, the LSTM model is built and trained using the training data; and finally, the model's performance is evaluated using the test data and predictions for future time series values are made.

The project's success will be primarily determined by the quality of the data and the suitability of the model design. To improve model performance, data preparation techniques and the selection of relevant hyperparameters should be addressed.
